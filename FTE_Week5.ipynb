From the Experts will look at some theory behind all the magic to prepare students for writing their own functions and classes (chapter 9) and demonstrate how functional programming concepts like `map()` and `reduce()` work (chapter 10)."

    "### 1. Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some terms and definitions to insure we are all talking about the same thing. **Note:** These definitions come from the author's experience rather than any particular textbook or dictionary. Your mileage may vary :).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function** - A reusable chunk of code that takes input and returns the output. The `add()` operation is a good example. `add()` is the function name for the + operation. + takes two numbers as input and gives one number as output. \n",
    "* **Method** - A method is a function that is part of a class and specifically designed to interact with the class's data in some way.\n",
    "* **Procedure** - The word 'procedure' in this context describes a function that does **not** return a value. We won't really have any use for procedures but some authors seem to use the words 'function' and 'procedure' interchangeably.\n",
    "* **Class** - A class is a template for creating objects. Consider a **class** to be a blueprint for creating objects of the same type. Generally, we create classes when we want to create a new variable *type* (conceptually).\n",
    "* **Object** - Objects are like the houses built from blueprints. Their structure is identical, although attributes like 'front door type' or 'main paint color' could vary.\n",
    "* **Decorator** - Decorators \"wrap\" functions and modify their behavior.\n",
    "* **Lambda function** - Lambda functions are 'anonymous functions,' that is functions without a name. They consist of only 1 line and are usually used in functions that take *other* functions as parameters, like map, reduce, filter, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't get too hung up on the terms. We will illustrate them in more detail as we go. "

    "### 2. Functions vs. methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, **functions** are a stand-alone package of code that takes input and returns output. The most obvious reason to package code as a function is that we want to reuse the same set of steps later. A less obvious reason is, if the code is collected in one place, it is far easier to debug and modify than if we have it scattered throughout the program and have to rely on our memory to find all the places. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods** are just special-purpose functions that belong to classes. We have already used tons of methods. Some examples:\n",
    "* `read_csv()` from DataFrame\n",
    "* `upper()`, 'lower()`, `split()` from string\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a stand-alone function, we use the `def` keyword with the name we want to give it and a list of input variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "`def my_function(input_variable):`\n",

    "    * I once had a student name a function \"print\" in his program. This conflicted with Python's `print()` so that every time he wanted to put something to the screen, it called his function and would crash.\n",
    "* The input variable, num, is also named arbitrarily but descriptively. This \"version\" of num only exists while the function is running, so it is OK to have other \"num\" variables in your code, although that might be confusing. For the nerds, this is known as **variable scope**.\n",

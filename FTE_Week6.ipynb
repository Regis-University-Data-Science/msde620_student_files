    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with dates and times is difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick quiz:** How many time zones does the United States have?\n",
    "1. 4 (Pacific, Mountain, etc.)\n",
    "2. 6 \n",
    "3. 8\n",
    "4. 11\n",
    "\n",
    "The reflex answer for most of us is #1 - four time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern), but that answer is wrong!\n",
    "\n",
    "From [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/usa):\n",
    "\n",
    ">**How Many Time Zones Are There in the US?**\n",
    "\n",
    ">There are 9 time zones by law in the USA and its dependencies, however, adding the time zones of 2 uninhabited US territories gives **11 time zones in total** \\[emphasis mine\\]. The contiguous US has 4 standard time zones. In addition Alaska, Hawaii, and 5 US dependencies all have their own time zones. As neither Hawaii nor the 5 dependencies use Daylight Saving Time (DST), there are only 6 corresponding DST time zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, times and time zones are a **nightmare** for programers. For example, a few years ago I worked for a company that created and sold software to hospitals for patient tracking and charting. With that thought in mind, consider this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many, if not all, hospital orders (medications, therapy, lab tests & results) are **EXTREMELY** time sensitive. In many cases, **_life or death_**-type time sensitive.\n",
    "2. During the change to Daylight Savings time in the spring, **almost an entire hour doesn't exist** (from 2:01 a.m. to 2:59 a.m.). What happens to orders that were written for \"every four hours\" and it falls on 2:28 a.m.?\n",
    "3. During the change from DST to Standard Time, **almost an entire hour exists twice**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer at that time (more than a decade ago), was to literally _turn off the application_ for the time-change hour, go back to charting everything by hand, then have the clinicians enter all the charting later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since **Pandas for Everyone** does a good job of highlighting Pandas datetime functionality, the remainder of this *From the Expert* will discuss datetime calculations using Python's native datetime library and then finish with topics pertinent to this week's lab."

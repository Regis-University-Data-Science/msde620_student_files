    "### How computers use binary and what does 64-bit mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers use binary (`0 and 1` or `off and on`) at the lowest level to store everything -- integers, floating point numbers, strings, etc. This is done primarily because transistors (the building blocks of electronic circuits) function as on/off switches. RAM is essentially just large square matrices of transistors, each one in an *off* or *on* state, plus some logic circuits that can read those states and report on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data moving from RAM to CPU or hard drive to RAM is represented as electrical voltages on a wire. 0 volts means \"off\" and 5 volts (for example) represents \"on\". The voltage on the wire (data line) will stay high or low for a prescribed amount of time to distinguish two 0s or 1s from just a very long pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say we have a sequence of 4 bits -- 0110 -- that we need to transmit from memory to the CPU. Given that each high or low pulse must be maintained for some length of time (to make the math easy we will use 1 second), the data transmission would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 (1 sec.)<br>\n",
    "-<br>\n",
    "1 (1 sec.)<br>\n",
    "-<br>\n",
    "1 (1 sec.)<br>\n",
    "-<br>\n",
    "0 (1 sec.)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called \"serial transmission\" and it should be fairly apparent that 4 bits would take 4 seconds. But, what would happen if we could have four of those wires, each one carrying a bit?\n",
    "\n",
    "0 | 1 | 1 | 0 (1 sec.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Four bits would only take 1 second, and then another four bits could be sent the next second, thus quadrupling the amount of data that can be moved in one time unit. If this represented 4 data lines from RAM to the CPU, it would be a **4 bit computer**."
